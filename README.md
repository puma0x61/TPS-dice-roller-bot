# TPS dice roller bot

A free and open source telegram bot that you can find [here](https://telegram.me/TPS_dice_roller_bot).

Made by  [me](https://github.com/PumaConcolor) and [Jacopo De Angelis](https://github.com/JacopoDeAngelis) using [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) in our spare time.

The primary function of the bot is to roll dice (with any number of sides), and other fun things related to TTRPGs of various types.
